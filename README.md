# Gesture-Controlled Presentation Documentation

## Overview

The **gesture-controlled-presentation** project is a novel implementation of a presentation tool that is operated through hand gestures, providing an immersive and interactive experience. This documentation aims to guide users on the functionality and gestures associated with the application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main files:

1. **main.py**: This file features the basic version of the presentation tool, incorporating essential drawing and navigation tools.

2. **extended.py**: Here, you'll find an extended version of the tool, offering more sophisticated drawing tools for an enhanced user experience. The extended version allows users to draw, adjust pointer size, decrease pointer size, and exit the application.

## Hand Gestures

The application utilizes hand gestures, with the left hand controlling the tool and the right hand serving as the pointer. The following gestures are associated with the left hand:

### 1. Draw
![Draw Gesture](https://github.com/Jay7221/gesture-controlled-presentation/assets/96529359/090111af-9e3e-43b6-88d3-d4720a27092c)

Use this gesture to activate the drawing tool.

### 2. Erase

Perform this gesture to activate the eraser tool and remove drawings.

### 3. Increase Pointer Size

Enlarge the pointer size with this gesture for better visibility.

### 4. Decrease Pointer Size

Use this gesture to reduce the pointer size as needed.

### 5. Exit
![Exit Gesture](https://github.com/Jay7221/gesture-controlled-presentation/assets/96529359/d5ff87b5-c69f-45b8-a616-cc80434ccda5)

## Reference

This project is a customization and implementation inspired by the "Hand Gesture Presentation" course by CVZone. You can find the course [here](https://www.computervision.zone/courses/hand-gesture-presentation/).

## Conclusion

The gesture-controlled presentation tool offers a unique and engaging way to interact with your presentations. Experiment with different gestures to make the most out of the drawing and navigation tools provided by the application. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to contribute to the project on GitHub.

Happy presenting!
